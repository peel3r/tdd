The “deception detection” system
- will analyse the micro-expressions of those seeking to enter EU territory
to see if they are being truthful about their personal background and intentions.
- Those arriving at the border will be required to have uploaded pictures
of their passport, visa and proof of funds.



- Travellers who have been flagged as low risk by the avatar &#42;,
and its lie detector, will go through a short re-evaluation
of their information for entry. Those judged to be of higher
risk will undergo a more detailed check.

- Border officials will use a handheld device to automatically
crosscheck information, comparing the facial images captured
during the pre-screening stage to passports and photos taken
on previous border crossings.

- When documents have been reassessed, and fingerprinting,
palm-vein scanning and face matching have been carried out,
the potential risk will be recalculated. A border guard will
then take over from the automated system.
